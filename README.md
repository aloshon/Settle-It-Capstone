# Settle-It-Capstone
My first capstone project designed to help users settle on something to watch with a nearby friend. The data comes from themoviedb API and it is randomized depending on which genre the user chooses. Once the session begins, User #1 simply chooses yes or no on the shows that are displayed, after 5 choices the session will switch to the next user. Once there is a match, notify the user that a decision has been made. User may also upload a review of the show they ended up watching. API URL = https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
