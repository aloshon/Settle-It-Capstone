# Settle-It-Capstone
This is my first capstone project designed to help users settle on something to watch with a nearby friend. The data comes from themoviedb API and it is randomized depending on which genre the user chooses. Once the session begins, User #1 is given a random list of show and they just simply chooses yes or no to the shows that are displayed. After 5 choices, user #1 hands the device over to User #2 and the session will switch to the next user. Once there is a match it will notify the users that a decision has been made. User may also upload a review of the show they ended up watching. API URL = https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
